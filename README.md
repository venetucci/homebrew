- Jack London started drinking in San Francisco in the late 1880s, and mentions steam beer in his 1913 autobiographical novel *John Barleycorn*: 
> "The first day I worked in the bowling alley, the barkeeper, according to custom, called us boys up to have a drink after we had been setting up pins for several hours. The others asked for beer. I said I'd take ginger ale. The boys snickered, and I noticed the barkeeper favoured me with a strange, searching scrutiny. Nevertheless, he opened a bottle of ginger ale. Afterward, back in the alleys, in the pauses between games, the boys enlightened me. I had offended the barkeeper. A bottle of ginger ale cost the saloon ever so much more than a glass of steam beer; and it was up to me, if I wanted to hold my job, to drink beer."

- ["A High-Tech Beer from Silicon Valley"](https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/15/business/a-high-tech-beer-from-silicon-valley.html) 1983 NYTimes article 
> "But in Silicon Valley, where billion- dollar companies such as Apple and Hewlett-Packard have started in living rooms and garages, one new micro-brewer is trying to meld a beer-lover's dream with the careful research and state-of-the-art manufacturing of a high-tech company. And Kenneth Kolance and his son, Jeffrey, know a lot about both fields. The elder Kolance is the co-founder of Bole & Babbage Inc., one of the first successful independent computer software companies and a pioneer in software engineering. Jeffrey is a recent graduate of the California Polytechnical Institute with a major in industrial technology and a minor in engineering management. His senior paper studied the organization of the physical plant of micro-breweries and the errors made by businesses already in the field. Armed with that knowledge, the Kolances decided in 1980 that they could make money in the micro-brewery business where others had failed. The result is a product that they call London Bitter, a draft, English- style beer."
